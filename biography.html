            dante gofar is a composer and music producer from Jakarta, Indonesia. His music blurs the lines between acoustic and electronic, seamlessly blending elements of jazz, rock, folk, and EDM into his own unique, melody-driven style.
            <br>
            <br>
            His musical journey started in his childhood, where he was fed a steady diet of music from all over the world thanks to his parents. 
            Whether it was Indonesian pop songs, 2000s techno and trance, Celtic folk, french house and disco, music was always a part of his life 
            growing up, eventually lending to his versatility across different styles and genres. However, it was video game music that truly sparked 
            his passion for the craft and pushed him to pursue music composition as something that would later become more than just a hobby.
            <br>
            <br>
            As a music producer, he creates original electronic music under the alias "SoundCirclet".
            He has produced several works in the Japanese electronic music scene, including being featured in AD: TRANCE 7  and AD: TRANCE 9, 
            two installments in a series of trance compilation albums by Japanese independent record label Diverse System. His remix of Intergalactic 
            Bound by Yunosuke and CircusP won the grand prize of the MIKUEXPO 10th Anniversary Remix Contest, hosted by Crypton Future Media. 
            He can also be heard as part of the music video game UNBEATABLE [white label], for which he contributed a remix of the song Empty Diary by Peak Divide.
            <br>
            <br>
            Currently, he is composing the music for a number of independent video games, and is also 
            working on an upcoming album to be released under their original artist name, SoundCirclet in 2025.
            <br>
            <br>
            When not working as a composer or music producer, he is a performing drummer, percussionist, as well as an Irish whistle player.
